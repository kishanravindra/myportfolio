                I have been working as iOS developer in
                Qwinix Technologies Pvt Ltd. With 8 Years of
                exhaustive experience in building mobile
                application and strong analytical,
                mathematical and logical skills, today i
                stand as the developer with go getter
                attitude and making the UI/UX designers
                happy with pixel perfect layouting in iOS.{' '}
                <br />
                <br />
                Besides my technical skills and experience,
                the strategical and analyzing skills iâ€™ve
                developed over time always makes my stand
                out among the crowd. Also the willingness to
                get the perfect outcome of the applications
                Which I develop and never compromising
                quality and put QA in a tough place to find
                bugs. <br />
                <br />
                In addition to the reusable, object oriented
                code i implement, I have a strong liking for
                implementing the animation and new
                Interactive design in the mobile
                applications. I love it when math and
                physics principles get into the code to get
                the incredible animations
